# Direct RNAseq
Code for mapping and counting reads generated by ONT Direct RNAseq (RNA002).

Raw reads (Q > 7, filtered by MinKNOW/Guppy basecalling) were mapped to the reference genome (GRCh38) using minimap2 (v 2.24). Samtools (v 1.16) was used to filter out alignments with low mapping quality (MAPQ < 10). Reads per gene were subsequently counted using featureCounts (v 2.0.0) using long-read counting mode (-L).
